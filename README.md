# Aganitha - Book Finder

The Book Finder app, built using the Google Books API, allows users to search and explore a vast collection of books with ease. By leveraging the powerful API, the app fetches detailed book information, including titles, authors, descriptions, publication dates, and cover images. Users can search for books by keyword, author, or title, and view results with pagination to navigate through multiple pages of books effortlessly. The app provides a sleek and responsive interface, offering a seamless browsing experience for readers looking to discover new books or dive deeper into their favorite genres.

## Known Limitations
* The Google Books API sometimes provides incomplete or inaccurate book details, such as missing publication dates, incorrect author information, or missing descriptions.
* While the API provides basic information about books , it doesnâ€™t offer access to the full text of the books themselves (unless they are public domain or available for preview). 
* The search functionality provided by the Google Books API is relatively basic. 

## Technology Stack
* React.js
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB
* React Router
* Context API for state management
* Lucide React for icons
* CSS for styling
* Google Books API

## Future Roadmap
* Allow users to create accounts and save their book collections, preferences, and reading history.
* Based on user reading habits and preferences, offer personalized book recommendations using machine learning algorithms.
* Provide more granular search filters such as genre, year of publication, ratings, language, and more.
